This project was built following a youtube tutuorial by Jason Weimann (Reference Vid: https://youtu.be/OR0e-1UBEOU) as a method of getting my feet wet with the Unity engine. It's a simple 2d game built to mimic some of the features and functionality of the widely popular mobile game angry birds.

The basic lessons/methods taught in this tutorial include:
1. Initial install of the unity engine
2. Importing art assets (all art assets in this project were imported from freely available sources: https://opengameart.org)
3. Setting up a scene
4. Sprites
5. RigidBody physics (Rigidbody2d)
6. Basic Unity C# programming to cover all the logic you see in the project.
7. Creating a 2d background as well as a collision enabled ground in the scene.
8. Input control hooks (OnButtonDown, OnMouseDrag, OnMouseUp).
9. Launching the bird sprite (AddForce using Vectors).
10. Creating Obstacles using imported art (Crates).
11. Line indicator created using Line Renderer with a basic arrow pattern created in GIMP and made into a material mesh.
12. Camera Control using the Unity CineMachine plugin.
13. Enemy Monsters with their own custom logic (all game logic programmed in C#).
14. Basic partical effects using imported art made into material meshes.
15. Made the Cloud particle system into a prefab for easy re-use.
16. Added several different levels of varying difficulty using all the components mentioned above.
17. Added level controller to handle logical flow through all the levels created.

More may be added to the project at a later date, at which time the README should be updated with the latest info. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my projects :)
